This repository contains the documentation regarding the applications developed in the IoT Lab of Universitat Stuttgart.

There are different important folders:

* **LIB**: contains common scripts of different applications. Basically has some scripts that can be used as layout when developing new applications. E.g. protocols like MQTT and HTTP
* **MBP**: this folder contains ready-to-deploy applications to the MBP platform.
* **SCENARIOS**: Contains applications developed to be deployed directly on the devices. It was developed before aiming to use the MBP.
* **ACTUATORS/DEVICES/SENSORS**: Folders containing scripts of the different building blocks.
