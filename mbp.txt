# MBP Setup on TPL Computer

## Environment

Setup ssh is needed before you can deploy devices to the mbp, so start generating the ssh (needed just in case of first run)

'''
ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa
'''

then copy the ssh id to all devices you want to deploy by running the following command

'''
ssh-copy-id host@ip
'''

where host = host name (usually pi case the device is a raspi, for example)

and ip = device ip (e.g. 129.69.209.121)

in case the above command does not work you can simply copy the ida_rsa.pub content from ~/.ssh/ folder of the computer  and paste to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Not sure if the ssh-keygen need to be done into the device in case it does not have the .ssh folder before copying it

## MBP Install

Clone and Run install shell script
